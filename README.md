👋 Hi there! Welcome to my GitHub profile!

🌟 What I’m working on:
I’m currently focused on a productivity App: Planner.

Planner is not your average to-do list. Instead of just listing tasks, it helps you allocate specific hours to your tasks, ensuring a more structured and effective approach to productivity. By organizing your day hour-by-hour, Planner helps you prioritize and stay on track, making it a powerful alternative to traditional to-do lists.

🚀 What’s Next?

I’m working on features like:

    📊 Analytics to track your productivity trends
